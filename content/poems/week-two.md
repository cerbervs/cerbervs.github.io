Tired like a bird dog, all but spent, just enough of himself left to trudge the
mile or so home.  
Ready to collapse as soon as the threshold has been crossed, bed not far from
the door of this tiny abode.  
A hard day's work done, sun from the window glinting off the hairs laid flat
across his back; hackles no longer raised at the fleeting thought of some tasty
morsel, falling fast from the sky.  
All of that is gone now, replaced by a full belly and long sleep, no dreams,
save those of tomorrow trials, same as today's.  

Like the dog, I too have no recourse.  
No choice other than the one that has been made for me. No chance to escape my
fate. I am too small, and too weak.  
I have been led by the hand down this darkened, muddied path, and I can no
longer see the way back.  
Thank you, I have missed the woods.
