So everyone has left, I am here alone,  
for a week, give or take.  
And this weight I've been feeling on my shoulders,  
it's on my chest now too.  
It's getting real heavy, it's starting to hurt real bad.  
Felt like I was scraping by, up there, with you.  
And now I'm home again, and I fucking hate that I have to be here.  
But there is no other way, just the road in front of me as I slip further from
you.  

I am so sorry I had to do this.  
It broke me too, and it will break me further; there's more to come, there
always is.  
My heart's been bleeding, it's been on my sleeve, but you can't see the blood.  
Good thing is, if it isn't in my chest, this weight can't crush it.  

We'll meet those final moments together, together.  
Seeing the last sunset from years and years apart; wholly different vantage
points.  
Silence as the last goodbye, I imagine.  
We'll see this through, until it is, and we can both rest.  
Because it's been a long slog, we fought hard, but this time, we lost.
