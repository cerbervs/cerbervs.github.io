If I am the sea, and you are my Moon,  
then I shall flow and ebb,  
and swell and crash,  
against the cliffs to stretch my height.

If I am the sea, all purple and blue  
with blacks and whites, all roiling in my depths,  
then I shall concentrate all my might,  
and reach toward you.

If I am the sea, no length shall stop me,  
no great ceiling of the sky,  
no vast amount of space, nor time,  
I shall find you, my Moon.

If I am the sea, no small hollow shall go unfilled,  
no crack, nor crevice, remaining empty  
for I will be at your side,  
for you are my Moon.
