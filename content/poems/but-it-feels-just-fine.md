So it begins. Here, now, in this car. Window rolled down.  
Cold air brushing my cheeks with it's snowy fingers.  
But it feels just fine.  
Noise. Endless noise cascading through the cracks in the doors. Seeping through the windshield, onto the seats.  
The passenger seat is empty. As it most often is now.  
But it feels just fine.  
I've been yearning for touch. I've been pining for the familiar scent of skin climbing up my nose, into my brain.  
My voice has been lingering in my throat. Slowly slipping back down to my chest.  
I can barely speak.  
But it feels just fine.  
Just a little longer, just a bit more. Hold out for another month.  
And yetâ€¦  
it feels just fine.
