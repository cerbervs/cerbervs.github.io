# Stuck

Here I am, between my rock and a hard place.  
I cannot even struggle to free myself.  
This weight won't let up.

It struck me, free falling from somewhere I do not know.  
And pinned me here.  
This boulder is so damn heavy.

Not a single budge, no nanometer of movement, for all that I squirm.  
I can barely breathe.  
This is crushing me.

I keep thinking about what it would be like to be free again.  
What I would give to draw in a full breath.  
This is killing me.
