As I awoke, glistening white, brittle little flakes were cascading down from a pitchy sky.  
No star adorning the upper reaches of my vision, my eyes were bleary.  
I had found myself in unfamiliar territory again.  
I stood, knees creaking, it being cold around me, of course they would.  
Still sickened from the day that lead me there, to that otherworldly street, empty and silent.  
I looked up from my scuffed boots, and lo!  
Appearing before me, you alighted softly on the snow.  
Bathed in heaven's fire you crouched to match my stooped frame, my eyes cast down for fear's sake.  
Gently you reached down, tendrils of flame dripping from your fingers, you cupped my chin.  
Lifted my face to meet your gaze, my cheeks branded with your fingerprints, tears falling fast from my eyes.  
I'd surely never been blessed like this, your visage shifting to the sweetest smile, melting me further down into the snow.  
You spoke no words, not a single sound, save the rippling tongues of fire dancing across you.  
For a solid minute I was locked with you there, in that alley, snow still crowning the light post above us.  
All at once, you were gone and I stood, straight this time, alone again.  
No trace of you to be seen; my face still warm, your fingerprints still seared into my skin.
