# Clutch

The addict will drink the sea until it becomes him.  
And just so, I would let you drown me in your darkest depths.  
Pull me under and clutch me in your currents, embraced for what would end as eternity.  
I'd gladly heave the air from my lungs to make room for more of you.  
Pour the contents of my visceral cavity out so you can fill my chest for the first time since my birth.  
Wash away my grit and grime;  
so when you have settled into the spaces no one else has dared to find, I am clean for you.
