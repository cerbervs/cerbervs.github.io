The coals will be banked, yes, but smolder forever.
There’s no letting this go completely. No way to forget you.
And that’s okay, I think. It’s a quiet longing that doesn’t need to be acknowledged.
One that I don’t think about until I’m awake in the middle of the night. Bolt upright in bed.">

<p>I don&rsquo;t think this fire will ever truly burn out.<br>
The coals will be banked, yes, but smolder forever.<br>
There&rsquo;s no letting this go completely. No way to forget you.<br>
And that&rsquo;s okay, I think. It&rsquo;s a quiet longing that doesn&rsquo;t need to be acknowledged.<br>
One that I don&rsquo;t think about until I&rsquo;m awake in the middle of the night. Bolt upright in bed.<br>
Sitting next to her, your replacement. Cold sweat dripping in bullets down my brow, the center of my back, along my spine.</p>
<p>Time will heal this, I&rsquo;m sure. It will erase you, maybe not from my head, but at least from my heart.<br>
I welcome the time that’s coming, when you have faded, voice fully vacated my mind.<br>
I hope it comes gently, treading lightly over my doorway, waltzing it&rsquo;s willowy way through my home.<br>
Maybe then I will find my peace, without you.</p>
