It seems far longer than it was and far shorter than it ever could have been.
Caught in some sort of limbo, we floated,
not daring to look down, not striving to reach up.
Gorging ourselves on the fruits we found on the underside of branches, tickling the tops of our heads.">

Gorging ourselves on the fruits we found on the underside of branches, tickling the tops of our heads.<br>
Here is where we part ways, friend.<br>
Step down from our dizzying height, I&rsquo;ll turn east, and you west.<br>
Turn your face to the sun, breathe in and step out.<br>
Keep walking, don&rsquo;t turn back, there&rsquo;s nothing for you that way.</p>
