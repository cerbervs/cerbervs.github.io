        <h1 id="demagogue">Demagogue</h1>
<p>I want you to fall for me, as if you slipped at the top of ten flights of stairs.<br>
Like you tried to grab the rungs for the banister, desperately clutched at them, only to realize they are slick with something and you can&rsquo;t get a grip.<br>
Sliding down the stairs, wooden, no carpeting, just hard edges to knock the breath from your body.<br>
Steep as they are, you ended up going head over heels, tumbling down, elbows thrown into walls, fingernails dug into any surface where they could find purchase.<br>
But to no avail.</p>
<p>The fall has claimed you, there&rsquo;s no way to stop it, and you&rsquo;ve still got six flights left.<br>
So maybe you close your eyes, begin to accept it for what it is, a cruel twist of fate.<br>
Maybe you lean into each turn of your body, let yourself meld with the stairs, momentarily, before tearing off toward your final destination.<br>
Slowly, as slowly as it can be for the speed at which you fall, you learn to love the lack of oxygen;<br>
the way it feels when you catch the stairs so hard your eyes water, fly open, and reveal the world again.<br>
The landing at the bottom is concrete, and it looks soft, like a proper resting place, cool and welcoming to your aching, bruised body.</p>
<p>Little did you know, as you were falling I came through the door at the end of the hall. Stepped through and heard your racket, coming from on high, somewhere I couldn&rsquo;t ascertain.<br>
So I ran, bolted like a scared dog, for the landing of the stairs, I had to see what was coming.<br>
And as we both reached the landing, I could see what was really going on.<br>
I know now that you&rsquo;re falling, and I&rsquo;ll be damned if I don&rsquo;t catch you.</p>
