<p>We will be the salt of the earth at the end of days.<br>
Returned from dust, to dust.<br>
Made from ash, molded by fire, and flame.<br>
We came into this world screaming, and we will not leave quietly, not without struggle.<br>
We will have stood tall at times, we will have crawled a time a time or two,<br>
and our hands and feet will be calloused.
Sometimes carrying each other, sometimes dragged by the little clothing we have left.</p>
<p>We will arrive<br>
at the perfect time<br>
to see him stand, with the sky on his shoulders.<br>
And we will nod as we pass by, limping, slightly lame, and silent. He will shrug. He knows struggle greater than we ever could.
A gentle smile will cross his lips, as we, among many, make our pilgrimage on.<br>
Your arm over my shoulders, I am stooped to bear your weight, so that we may march unto the sun.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve come so far,<br>
and we&rsquo;ve pushed up with all our might, out of frozen ground,<br>
like seeds of something great.<br>
We&rsquo;ve got to keep on going,<br>
we can&rsquo;t stop.<br>
I&rsquo;ve given too much to this cause, I won&rsquo;t let up.<br>
For years we have trudged along, and for years more we will continue.<br>
And I swear to you, I won&rsquo;t let us fall.<br>
We will press onward, until only God can stop us.<br>
Because I will carry you, as Atlas carries the sky.</p>
