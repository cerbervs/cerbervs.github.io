No star adorning the upper reaches of my vision, my eyes were bleary.
I had found myself in unfamiliar territory again.

Still sickened from the day that lead me there, to that otherworldly street, empty and silent.
I looked up from my scuffed boots, and lo!">

      <p>As I awoke, glistening white, brittle little flakes were cascading down from a pitchy sky.<br>
No star adorning the upper reaches of my vision, my eyes were bleary.<br>
I had found myself in unfamiliar territory again.<br>
I stood, knees creaking, it being cold around me, of course they would.<br>
Still sickened from the day that lead me there, to that otherworldly street, empty and silent.<br>
I looked up from my scuffed boots, and lo!<br>
Appearing before me, you alighted softly on the snow.<br>
Bathed in heaven&rsquo;s fire you crouched to match my stooped frame, my eyes cast down for fear&rsquo;s sake.<br>
Gently you reached down, tendrils of flame dripping from your fingers, you cupped my chin.<br>
Lifted my face to meet your gaze, my cheeks branded with your fingerprints, tears falling fast from my eyes.<br>
I&rsquo;d surely never been blessed like this, your visage shifting to the sweetest smile, melting me further down into the snow.<br>
You spoke no words, not a single sound, save the rippling tongues of fire dancing across you.<br>
For a solid minute I was locked with you there, in that alley, snow still crowning the light post above us.<br>
All at once, you were gone and I stood, straight this time, alone again.<br>
No trace of you to be seen; my face still warm, your fingerprints still seared into my skin.</p>
