<p>So it begins. Here, now, in this car. Window rolled down.<br>
Cold air brushing my cheeks with it&rsquo;s snowy fingers.<br>
But it feels just fine.<br>
Noise. Endless noise cascading through the cracks in the doors. Seeping through the windshield, onto the seats.<br>
The passenger seat is empty. As it most often is now.<br>
But it feels just fine.<br>
I&rsquo;ve been yearning for touch. I&rsquo;ve been pining for the familiar scent of skin climbing up my nose, into my brain.<br>
My voice has been lingering in my throat. Slowly slipping back down to my chest.<br>
I can barely speak.<br>
But it feels just fine.<br>
Just a little longer, just a bit more. Hold out for another month.<br>
And yet…<br>
it feels just fine.</p>
