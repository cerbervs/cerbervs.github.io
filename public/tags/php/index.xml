      <description>What was I doing in the first place? To give you a little background on this issue, first I have to mention that this is a work project. We do all of our development in PHP, and use many libraries. All of these libraries are reviewed by my senior dev or our team lead. We&amp;rsquo;ve had a lot of success in narrowing down which packages really fit our use case, and picking high quality packages.</description>
